so does anyone cool use this thing...?

Okay, so the features don't convince you, the documentation doesn't convince you, you want to see what *other* people think about Sol? Well, aside from the well-wishes that come through in the issue tracker, here's a few things floating around about sol2 that I occasionally get pinged about:


* (Reddit) Posts on reddit about it!
	- https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/4a8gy7/sol2_lua_c_binding_framework/
	- https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/4x82hd/plain_c_versus_lua_libraries_benchmarking_speed/
* (CppNow) sol2 was mentioned in a comparison to other scripting languages by ChaiScript developer, Jason Turner (@lefticus), at a conference!
	- https://github.com/lefticus/presentations/blob/master/HowAndWhyToAddScripting.md
* (CppCast) Showed up in CppCast with Elias Daler!

* (Eevee) A really nice and neat developer/artist/howaretheysotalented person is attempting to use it for zdoom!

* (Twitter) Retweets by ThePhD from others!

* Somehow landed on a Torque3D thread... that's nothing something ThePhD was planning for...!

And, of course, ThePhD uses it. Isn't that enough?

Are you using sol2 for something neat? Want it to be featured here or think it's unfair that ThePhD hasn't found it yet? Well, drop an issue in the repo or send an e-mail!
